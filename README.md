# File-Organiser

## Overview

File-Organiser is a Python script designed to help you organize your files efficiently. It automatically organizes your file into subdirectory based on a specific naming convention

## Features
- Auto create and Move files to specific directories by naming convention

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Ofor-David/File-Organiser.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd File-Organiser
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage
In the directory where this script is runing, create any file and name it in this format. `_projects-python-test-dummy.py`
.This would save the file in `source/projects/python/test/dummy.py` where `source` is the directory you put the script. You can use any directory name of your choice.

Make sure to start with an `_` and seperate each directory name by `-`, the last part would be used for the filename. You can chain as many directories as you want. if a directory doesn't exist, the script automatically creates the directory.

ðŸš¨ **NOTE!!**  The script overrides the file in the new directory if it already exists
